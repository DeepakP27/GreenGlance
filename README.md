# GreenGlance

GreenGlance is an innovative app designed to help users make eco-friendly choices by streamlining the recycling process. Whether accessed on mobile devices, iPads, or desktops, the app offers a seamless experience that tracks the total number of scans users make and the kilograms of carbon emissions saved. The app’s core feature allows users to scan images of trash using their camera or gallery, even if there are multiple items in the image. With the support of a custom-trained model and OpenAI’s Vision API, GreenGlance identifies the material of each item, quantifies the amount of trash, and estimates its carbon emissions, giving users a clear understanding of their environmental impact.

GreenGlance takes it further by offering additional features such as a chatbot that answers questions about safe environmental practices, and access to the three closest recycling centers based on the user’s location. To keep users motivated, especially younger audiences, the app includes challenges based on the number of trash scans completed. These challenges gamify eco-conscious actions, rewarding users as they reach milestones like "Scan Challenge Easy" and "Eco Warrior Hard," making environmental responsibility engaging and fun.
